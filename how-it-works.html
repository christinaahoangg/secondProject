				<h3>Our Plans</h3>
				<p>You can eat as much as you want, at $10.40 per meal. We have breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks. Tell us about your limitations or allergies and we will make sure to adjust the diet accordingly. We offer different types of diet, such as low carbs and ketones. Choose the steam that suits your lifestyle. Once you select your stream, you can set your own meal schedule. If you don't like the menu for that day, you can choose from our seasonal menu. The more meals you buy, the more money you save per meal. Please see our pricing plan.</p>
